## 📊 Visualizations

Check out the `visualizations/` folder for:
- Power output comparisons between bacterial strains
- Efficiency analysis over time
- Voltage-current relationships

## 🧬 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib (data visualization)
- NumPy (calculations)
- Pandas (data analysis)

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Bacteria that produce electricity could revolutionize:
- **Clean Energy**: Renewable bioelectricity generation
- **Wastewater Treatment**: Energy recovery while cleaning water
- **Remote Power**: Sensors and devices in hard-to-reach areas
- **Sustainability**: Carbon-neutral energy solutions

## 🔍 Key Findings

This project explored how different bacterial strains generate electricity through:
- Microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology
- Electron transfer mechanisms
- Efficiency optimization strategies

## 📝 Code Examples

The `code/` folder contains simplified demonstrations of:
- Basic bacterial analysis framework
