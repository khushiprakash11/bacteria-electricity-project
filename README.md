# Electricity-Producing Bacteria Project

## About This Project
I researched bacteria that can produce electricity and analyzed their potential for renewable energy.

## What I Built
- Python programs to analyze bacterial electricity generation
- Calculations for energy output
- Comparison of different bacterial strains
- Data visualizations

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Data analysis tools

## Why This Matters
Bacteria that produce electricity could help with:
- Clean energy generation
- Wastewater treatment
- Powering small devices

## Note
This is a showcase. My detailed code and research data are kept private.
